# Repo for Redhat IOT Project Backend

This project will live on the server as connected Docker containers. The three essential containers will be the webserver (Nagios or Apache2), the application (flask python app), and a database to persist the data to disk (MySQL).  

To run the Flask app on the local net for dev work: flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80
